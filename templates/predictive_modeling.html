      Question: Which Data Science Predictive Modeling techniques are the most
      suitable to answer the questions given in the project assignment?
      <br>

    <p class="px-5">
      In the process of selecting a model for our data analysis, several critical factors come into play. 
      These include the scale and quality of the data, the computational resources available for analysis, 
      and, importantly, the specific objectives we aim to achieve with our analysis. Given that our focus 
      lies on delving into big data related to shopper demographics while operating within constraints of 
      limited computational resources, it becomes imperative to choose models that can efficiently handle 
      the volume and complexity of our dataset while providing meaningful insights.

      After careful consideration, we have identified two promising modeling options that align well 
      with our data and objectives:

      <li class="ms-5 mb-2">
        Logistic Regression: This classic statistical technique serves as a powerful tool for binary 
        classification tasks. By employing logistic regression, we can assess the relationship between 
        various demographic attributes and overall customer engagement. Through this method, we aim to 
        identify which attributes exhibit a high degree of correlation with customer engagement metrics. 
        By doing so, we can gain valuable insights into the demographic factors that significantly influence 
        customer behavior and engagement.
        <br>
        K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): As a non-parametric classification algorithm, KNN offers a flexible 
        approach to pattern analysis within our dataset. By leveraging the concept of similarity between 
        data points, KNN allows us to identify clusters of attributes that exhibit high correlation. 
        This makes it an ideal choice for exploring patterns and relationships across the entirety of our 
        dataset. Through the application of KNN, we can uncover hidden trends and associations within the 
        data, providing valuable insights into the underlying structure of shopper demographics and their 
        impact on customer engagement.

      By leveraging these modeling techniques, we aim to extract actionable insights from our 
      data that can inform strategic decision-making and drive business growth. Through the 
      combination of logistic regression and KNN, we can unlock the full potential of our big data 
      analytics efforts, gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that drive customer 
      engagement in the retail landscape.
